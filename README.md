# SQL

# General Information
Using 6 different datasets, I pulled the employees' information, department managers' information, department number for each employee, list of all employees whose first name is Hercules and whose last name starts with the letter B, a list of all the Sales employees, a list of all Sales and Development employees and the frequency counts for employee last names. 
Using Postgresql, I defined the tables with data types, references and constraints, and imported the data from the csv files.  Lastly I have created an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).
